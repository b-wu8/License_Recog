虽然还是没确定用哪个框架，先装上再说
# PyTorch Installation Guide

You will need:

Python 3.6

PyTorch or TensorFlow

CUDA (Recommended, but not necessary)

## Steps:

Go to [PyTorch Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally), and follow the instruction from there to install PyTorch.

If you want to install CUDA, which is a framework that utilizes the full potential of GPU training, go to [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) and follow instructions from there.

To test if you have PyTorch properly set up, open up a python3.6 prompt.

And do:
```
import torch

print(torch.__version__)
```
If a version number shows up, then you are good to go :)
